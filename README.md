# Subject-specific-hazard-estimation

The central idea of this paper is to compare responses of several subjects in presence of censoring and subject specific variation. We develop a semiparametric mixed model for fitting
subject specific hazard curves to a set of censored failure times. A spline-based model and a
mixed effects model framework for smoothing are used. Efficient estimators of fixedl parameters and predictors of the random components are derived and their asymptotic properties
studied. This is a generalization of the method proposed by Cai et al. (2002) to allow
for additional subject specific variation. The results are illustrated using two motivating
examples.
